= Extra field editor plugins for jinplace =

This repo holds extra field editors for jinplace.

It is a forum for experimentation and discussion. Any contribution
will be accepted here, no matter how obscure the use-case.

Widely used plugins may be selected for an 'official' extras package or
to be added to the main jinplace package.

== Naming conventions ==
All editors will have a name that does not and cannot clash with a name
in the main jinplace project.  This is achieved at the moment by
starting the name with 'extra:'
A suffix may be used to indicate different versions or variations on a
similar editor control.

The rules are loose at the moment but may firm up as more are added.

Since a colon is not a valid character for an identifier, you must use
array notation to define it. For example:

<pre code=js>
$.fn.jinplace.editors['extra:checkbox'] = {
    // implementation here...
}
</pre>
